				<p>Note: the clap entity is an intermediary table between the member table and the blog table. It allows for a m-to-n relationship, by having 1-to-n relationships with both member and blog. This site allows members to clap multiple times for a single blog, so this is required,since each member can give a different number of claps. it is NOT the same as a "like" in Facebook</p>
